# Applying statistical and mathematical techniques to solve real-world problems

### Short projects to demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. These are personal projects from different areas of my interest.

#### Projects:
* [NBA Calendar](https://github.com/ddantasds/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/NBA%20calendar/NBA%20season%20calendar.ipynb)
* [Gradiend Descent from scracth](https://github.com/ddantasds/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Gradiend%20Descent%20Algorithm/Gradient%20Descent%20Algorithm.ipynb)
